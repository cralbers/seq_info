# filepaths

- Smith lab project directory: ``/fs/ess/PAS2905``

# important

- any jobs you run **must be run on the Ascend cluster** (perks of being [COM](https://www.osc.edu/resources/technical_support/supercomputers/ascend/osu_college_of_medicine_compute_service))


# logging in via ssh

1. In terminal/command line run: 
  `` $ ssh username@ascend.osc.edu ``
  and then enter your OSC password when prompted
     - You can substitute in any cluster where ascend is in the hostname (ex. ``username@cardinal.osc.edu``) if you want to
1. You will initially be dumped in your home dir (ex. ``/users/PAS2905/username``)

# links and resources

## very helpful !

- [available software](https://www.osc.edu/resources/available_software/browse_software)
  - list of all of the available software on OSC, make sure to filter by system! 

## basic management

- [my.osc.edu](https://my.osc.edu/)
  - general account management (change password, monitor job activity, get project info etc)
- [ondemand.osc.edu](https://ondemand.osc.edu/)
  - online access to HPC (download and upload files, manage jobs, SSH, start interactive GUI sessions, look at system status)
  - tbh i only use this to start interactive sessions, other than that i find it pretty clunky to use
- [osc.edu](https://www.osc.edu/)
  - documentation and resources for OSC
